📚 Fullstack Journey using MERN 🚀

Welcome to my Fullstack Learning Hub! 🌍 This repository is not just a showcase of projects but a living journal of my journey in mastering the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js) 🛠️. Dive into the world of web development with me as I share projects, files, and code snippets along the way. 💻✨

🧭 What's Inside?
📝 Projects: Full-fledged applications built during my learning process.
📂 Code Files: Individual files that demonstrate specific concepts or techniques.
🧪 Experiments: Small, focused experiments with the MERN stack.
📖 Notes & Insights: Documentation and insights as I progress through each stage of learning.

🛠️ Tech Stack
Frontend: React.js ⚛️, HTML5 📄, CSS3 🎨
Backend: Node.js 🟢, Express.js 🚀
Database: MongoDB 🍃
Version Control: Git & GitHub 🐙
